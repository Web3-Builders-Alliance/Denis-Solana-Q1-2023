To Whom it May Concern:

I submit this letter of intent for my Capstone project as part of Q1 Solana Cohort for WBA Institute.

The name of the project SolSnoop (IDLXtractor? Solidl?) - Solana Program IDL extractor using revers engineering.

The reason I want to do this project is to solve the problem of programs missing IDL in Solana ecosystem.

The project should create IDL for most of program binaries in Solana.
I plan to use Rust compiler, Anchor framework and [ELFIO](https://github.com/serge1/ELFIO) for reverse engineering .

Thank you, 
Denis.
